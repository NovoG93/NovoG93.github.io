__Abstract:__ For public emergencies such as nuclear accidents or natural disasters, an urgent and reliable description as well as an evaluation of the environ- ment form the basis of all organized search and res- cue (S&R) team plans and actions. If this informa- tion is not available the risks for the rescue services increases dramatically. Mobile robots help to mini- mize these risks by providing information about the disaster site to rescue teams. This paper discusses the needs and requirements of mobile robots in S&R application areas such as nu- clear disasters and evaluates results achieved during the ENRICH 2019 trial based on the system architec- ture of the mobile S&R robot ”Robbie” of UAS Tech- nikum Vienna. The successful participation of the ENRICH 2019 show that the mobile robot is capa- ble of performing S&R actions during emergencies.
