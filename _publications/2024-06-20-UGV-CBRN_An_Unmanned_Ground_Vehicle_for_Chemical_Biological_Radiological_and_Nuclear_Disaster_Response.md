__Abstract:__ Robotic search and rescue (SAR) supports response teams by accelerating disaster assessment and by keeping operators away from hazardous environments. In the event of a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) disaster, robots are deployed to identify and locate radiation sources. Human responders then assess the situation and neutralize the danger. The presented system takes a step toward enhanced integration of robots into SAR teams. Integrating autonomous radiation mapping with semi-autonomous substance sampling and online analysis of the CBRN threat lets the human operator localize and assess the threat from a safe distance. Two LiDARs, an IMU, and a Geiger counter are used for mapping the surrounding area and localizing potential radiation sources. A mobile manipulator with six Degrees of Freedom manipulates valves and samples substances that are analyzed by an onboard Raman spectrometer. The human operator monitors the mission’s progression from a remote location defining target locations and directing the semi-autonomous manipulation processes. Diverse recovery behaviours aid robot deployment, system state monitoring, as well as recovery of hard- and software. Field tests showcase the capabilities of the presented system during trials at the CBRN disaster response challenge European Robotics Hackathon (EnRicH).
