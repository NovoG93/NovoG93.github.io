  abstract  = {Intelligent mobile robots and service robots are central parts of autonomous productions and flexible manufacturing. Interconnected industrial robot-based automation allows customized productions for which mobile robots are used for transport of material and tools. The digital factory of the UAS Technikum Wien is a research project which focuses on experimental evaluation of novel technologies for digital manufacturing. This paper discusses applications of mobile and service robots in the digital factory. Based on a production use case, we analyze several methods for navigation in terms of accuracy of those approaches and discuss safety aspects.},
