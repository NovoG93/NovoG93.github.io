  abstract  = {Adverse weather conditions, such as snow-covered roads, represent a challenge for autonomous vehicle research. This is particularly challenging as it might cause misalignment between the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and the actual direction of travel. In this paper, we extend previous work in the field of autonomous vehicles on snow-covered roads and present a novel approach for side-slip angle estimation that combines perception with a hybrid artificial neural network pushing the prediction horizon beyond existing approaches. We exploited the feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks and the dynamic time series relationship learning capabilities of gated recurrent units and combined them with a motion model to estimate the side-slip angle. Subsequently, we evaluated the model using the 3DCoAutoSim simulation platform, where we designed a suitable simulation environment with snowfall, friction, and car tracks in snow. The results revealed that our approach outperforms the baseline model for prediction horizons â©¾ 2 seconds. This extended prediction horizon has practical implications, by providing drivers and autonomous systems with more time to make informed decisions, thereby enhancing road safety.},
