  abstract  = {For public emergencies such as nuclear accidents or natural disasters, an urgent and reliable description as well as an evaluation of the environment form the basis of all organized search and rescue (S&R) team plans and actions. If this information is not available the risks for the rescue services increases dramatically. Mobile robots help to minimize these risks by providing information about the disaster site to rescue teams. This paper discusses the needs and requirements of mobile robots in S&R application areas such as nuclear disasters and evaluates results achieved during the ENRICH 2019 trial based on the system architecture of the mobile S&R robot "Robbie" of UAS Tech-nikum Vienna. The successful participation of the ENRICH 2019 show that the mobile robot is capable of performing S&R actions during emergencies.},
