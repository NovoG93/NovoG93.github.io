  abstract  = {In navigation activities, kinematic parameters of a mobile vehicle play a significant role. Odometry is most commonly used for dead reckoning. However, the unrestricted accumulation of errors is a disadvantage using this method. As a result, it is necessary to calibrate odometry parameters to minimize the error accumulation. This paper presents a pipeline based on sequential least square programming to minimize the relative position displacement of an arbitrary landmark in consecutive time steps of a kinematic vehicle model by calibrating the parameters of applied model. Results showed that the developed pipeline produced accurate results with small datasets.},
