Hello! My name is Georg Novotny, and I am a passionate researcher and engineer with a strong focus on autonomous vehicles. I am currently pursuing my PhD in System Identification & Parameter Estimation for Autonomous Vehicles at the Johannes Kepler University (JKU). My research is centered around developing innovative solutions to enhance the capabilities of autonomous vehicles and create a safer, more efficient transportation ecosystem.

In addition to my PhD, I am devoted to advancing the field of robotics through my work on the RVIZ2 plugin, which aims to improve the visualization of vision_msgs. I am also in the process of writing my first book, "ROS 2 From Zero to Hero Using RCLPY" where I share my expertise on the basics of ROS 2, including debugging, simulation, nodes, services, actions, executors, callback groups, and motion control for mobile robots. The book also features exciting projects on path planning, reinforcement learning, and tracking.

When I'm not immersed in the world of robotics and autonomous vehicles, I love to stay active and challenge myself through sports climbing and sailing. I'm also an avid close-up magician, constantly learning new tricks and techniques to entertain and amaze those around me.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my research, projects, and other interests. Thank you for stopping by!
