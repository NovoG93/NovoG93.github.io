Hello everyone! üëã My name is Georg Novotny and I am a passionate researcher and engineer with a strong focus on autonomous vehicles üöó. I am currently pursuing my PhD in System Identification & Parameter Estimation for Autonomous Vehicles at the [Chair for Intelligent Transport Systems Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/en/intelligent-transport-systems/) (JKU-ITS), while working as a Platform Engineer at [MIC](https://www.mic-cust.com/).

My research focuses on developing innovative solutions to enhance the capabilities of autonomous vehicles and create a safer and more efficient transportation ecosystem üåç.

During my work at [JKU](https://www.jku.at/en/intelligent-transport-systems/) and [UAS Technikum Wien](https://www.technikum-wien.at/) I have been involved in several exciting projects, including the development of a [ROS-based Autonomous Vehicle](https://youtu.be/-J4XOD5EFN0)[^foonote-JKUITS], the implementation of a [ROS-based Last Mile Delivery Robot](https://youtu.be/h59YNcFKyOU)[^foonote-JKULMD], the creation of a [ROS-based Search and Rescue Robot](https://www.technikum-wien.at/en/news/robots-as-disaster-relief-workers/)[^foonot-Taurob] üöÅ, and the creation, maintenance, and improvement of a container image üì¶ for teaching [ROS/ROS 2](https://github.com/TW-Robotics/Docker-ROS). With FH Technikum Wien, I was involved in the [Enrich 2019](https://enrich-2019.european-robotics.eu/) as a system integrator and developer and led the development and system architecture for the [Enrich 2023](https://enrich.european-robotics.eu/)[^footnote-Enrich23-1][^footnote-Enrich23-2].

My enthusiasm for working with container images üñ•Ô∏è led me to my current role at MIC, where I am responsible for developing and maintaining Helm Charts, CI/CD pipelines, and local Kubernetes development environments. I am a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) üéì, and am currently studying for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) certification.

I also contributed to the [ROS 2 vision_msgs package](https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/tree/ros2) by creating a [RVIZ2 plugin](https://github.com/NovoG93/vision_msgs_rviz_plugins) to improve the visualisation of 3D vision_msgs. I also created three Gazebo-Classic ROS 2 simulations to simulate a [Toyota Prius](https://github.com/NovoG93/car_demo) üöó, to simulate the holonomic [Festo Robotino V3](https://github.com/NovoG93/robotino) ü§ñ, and to simulate a [simple drone](https://github.com/NovoG93/sjtu_drone) ‚úàÔ∏è. I am also in the process of writing my first book üìñ, *"ROS 2 From Zero to Hero Using RCLPY"*, where I share my expertise on the basics of ROS 2, including debugging, simulation, nodes, services, actions, executors, callback groups, and motion control for mobile robots. The book will also feature exciting projects on path planning, state estimation, and more ü§ì.

When I'm not immersed in the world of robotics and autonomous vehicles, I like to stay active and challenge myself through sport climbing üßó and sailing ‚õµ.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my [research](https://novog93.github.io/publications/), [projects](https://novog93.github.io/portfolio/), and [other interests](https://novog93.github.io/year-archive/). Thanks for stopping by! üôå
