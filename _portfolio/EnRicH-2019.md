# Transformative Robotics: Our Milestone at EnRicH 2019
In the shadow of the dormant Zwentendorf Nuclear Power Plant, a beacon of technological advancement shone brightly as EnRicH 2019 brought together the brightest minds in robotics. This unique event, focusing on research and development rather than competition, fostered an atmosphere where innovation could thrive. Teams from around the globe converged to address complex challenges in the radiological and nuclear (RN) sectors, pushing the limits of robotic capabilities. Our team, armed with a deep understanding of robotic engineering and a passion for problem-solving, was poised to tackle these challenges head-on. At EnRicH 2019, we were not just participants; we were pioneers, exploring uncharted territories of robotics in RN environments.

## Unveiling Innovation at the European Robotics Hackathon

At the heart of Austria's Zwentendorf Nuclear Power Plant, EnRicH 2019 unfolded as a pioneering event in robotics. It wasn't just a gathering — it was a fusion of minds and machines, confronting the intricate challenges in radiological and nuclear (RN) fields. This R&D-centric, non-competitive forum was a cradle of collaborative genius, setting the stage for real-world robotics application.

### The Challenges: Mapping, Manipulation and Search & Rescue

I participated as system architect of the [TAUT](https://enrich-2019.european-robotics.eu/documents/ENRICH_TeamInformation-TeamAustrianTechnology.pdf) Team, and our missions consisted of:

- Creating a digital map of the 3D area and detecting, measuring, and marking radiation sources.
- Identifying a specific radioactive coolant pipe and precisely closing its valve.
- Locating and rescuing a trapped worker dummy inside the environment.

Executed in a real power plant setting, these tasks presented layers of complexity, simulating unpredictable real-life scenarios.

We presented our design solutions with the following papers:

- [Robbie–A tele-operated robot with autonomous capabilities for EnRicH-2019 robotics trial](https://doi.org/10.3217/978-3-85125-663-5-22) [[get the pdf](files/paper/Robbie–A_tele_operated_Robot_With_Autonomous_Capabilities_for_EnRicH-2019robotics_trial.pdf)]
- [A Mobile Robot Platform for Search and Rescue Applications](https://doi.org/10.2507/30th.daaam.proceedings.131) [[get the pdf](files/paper/A_Mobile_Robot_Platform_For_Search_And_Rescue_Applications.pdf)]
- [Design and Implementation of a Mobile Search and Rescue Robot](https://doi.org/10.3217/978-3-85125-752-6-06) [[get the pdf](files/paper/Design_and_Implementation_of_a_Mobile_Search_and_Rescue_Robot.pdf)]

### Our Solution: A Multi-SLAM Approach

In developing our robotic solution, we focused on creating a system that could effectively navigate and perform tasks in high-risk environments, such as those presented by nuclear disasters. Our robot, named Robbie, was a result of extensive research and development efforts, as detailed in our papers presented at the event.

Robbie featured a robust mechanical construction and a sophisticated sensor suite, including multiple cameras and LIDARs, enabling it to map environments in 3D and detect radiation sources accurately. The combination of tele-operation and autonomous capabilities allowed Robbie to adapt to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of disaster scenarios, ensuring both effectiveness and safety.

The challenges at EnRicH 2019 included not only mapping and radiation detection but also the precise manipulation of objects and the rescue of human dummies. Robbie's design addressed these challenges head-on, demonstrating the potential of mobile robotics in enhancing disaster response and search and rescue operations.

Our approach showcased the integration of advanced navigation algorithms, real-time data processing, and autonomous decision-making, underlining the importance of robotics in critical real-world applications.
